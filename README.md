# House MD Analysis
~Analysis derived from House, MD dialogue transcripts~

## SUMMARY [v1]

### About House
* House had the most vocabularies compared to the others. Obviously, since he's the main character.
* House said 69 lie/lies/lied/lying words. Quite enough. Considering "Everybody lies" jargon was being campaigned through this season. But the minus is 'lie' as in lie down could be mixed in there.

### Commentary on Characters' nouns/adjectives/verbs
* I'm a bit dissapointed that the differences between everyone's noun/adj/verb are not that noticeable. Oh except Cuddy's nouns. That's so her lol.
* "cancer" spotted on Wilson's nouns. Score! And "die" lol (must be talking about his patients)
* Uh, apparently, Wilson said "uh" the most among the characters.
* Chase said "poison" 12 times. Did he jump onto poisoning on DDX too much in this season? I forgot
* Cameron said "history" 11 times. Ptient history I guess. She cared about them the most, huh?
* "brain" for our neurologist Foreman. And he said "treatment" the most. What prompted that?  
* "need" appeared on Wilson's and Cameron's top verbs. Both were bleeding-heart-character. Is there any correlation?

### What to improve later
* make a visualization
* seek a way to distinguish 'unique' noun/adj/verb for the characters (odd ratio?)
